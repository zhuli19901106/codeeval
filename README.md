# codeeval
Here's the archive of solved problems.

I'm currently using the problems on CodeEval to train python programming.

Update:
I've finished the "easy" and "moderate" section.
After trying a few problems of the "hard" section, I decide to quit.
The quality of the problems are not so good as I expected. I don't learn much after solving the problems.
Data structure? Algorithm? Optimization? I don't see nothing.
